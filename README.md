ðŸ‘‹ Hello ALL! Iâ€™m @Python125 (PythonMonty). Yes, I like Monty Python among many other great comedic acts. Iâ€™m a front-end-focused developer with experience in Vue, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Bootstrap, and SCSS, with exposure to React. Iâ€™ve also built projects using NestJS, Prisma, and some Python, giving me exposure to backend development. Always looking for new assignments and/or to collaborate with others. Reach me directly at andrewnovosel90@gmail.com. Also, I'm on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-novosel-3a59b41ba/ and Twitter: https://x.com/PythonMonty5
