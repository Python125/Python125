- ðŸ‘‹ Hello ALL! Iâ€™m @Python125 (PythonMonty). Yes, I like Monty Python among many other great comedic acts. I'm a front-end developer bringing my JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and creative skills to enhance my client's online goals. Take a look at some of my repos to get an idea of what I've been up to. Always looking for new assignments and/or to collaborate with others. Reach me directly at andrewnovosel90@gmail.com. Also, I'm on LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-novosel-3a59b41ba/ and Twitter: https://x.com/PythonMonty5
